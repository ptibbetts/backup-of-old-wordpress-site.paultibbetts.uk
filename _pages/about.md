Hi, my name's Paul and you're currently looking at my website.

<img class="u-roundEdges" src="https://placehold.it/1280x840&amp;text=😎" alt="" />

I'm CTO/Co-Founder at GoProspr which means I'm currently spending alternate weeks in Birmingham and London in the UK.

For now the best online version of my CV is my <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/paultibbetts">LinkedIn profile</a>.
<h2>what I'm interested in right now</h2>
Inspired by <a href="https://sivers.org/now">Derek Sivers' now page</a>, here's a list of things I'm currently working towards:
<ul>
 	<li>Bootstrapping a company and releasing GoProspr's MVP</li>
 	<li>Organising the next Laravel Birmingham meetup</li>
 	<li>Writing articles for this website</li>
 	<li>Improving my health and fitness</li>
</ul>
<!-- You can read more about these on my own <a href="/now">now page</a>. -->

<h2>about this website</h2>
I have my own site so that I can own my own data. I'll be adding <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com">IndieWeb</a> features to it on an ongoing basis.

It's currently built with WordPress using the <a href="https://roots.io/trellis">Trellis</a>, <a href="https://roots.io/bedrock">Bedrock</a> and <a href="https://roots.io/sage">Sage</a> stack by the <a href="https://roots.io">Roots</a> team.

It's made up of four parts, there's:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://ptibbetts.github.io/styles.paultibbetts.uk/">the styleguide</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/ptibbetts/allusion">the front-end code</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/ptibbetts/paultibbetts.uk">the back-end code</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/ptibbetts/backup-of.paultibbetts.uk">the backup</a></li>
</ul>
