Hi, my name's Paul and you're currently looking at my website.

<img class="u-roundEdges" src="https://placehold.it/1280x840&amp;text=ðŸ˜Ž" alt="" />

I'm the CTO and one of the Co-Founders at GoProspr. 

At the moment I'm spending alternate weeks in Birmingham and London whilst we build the first version of our app.

For now the best online version of my CV is my <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/paultibbetts">LinkedIn profile</a>.
<h2>what I'm interested in right now</h2>
Inspired by <a href="https://sivers.org/now">Derek Sivers' now page</a>, here's a list of things I'm currently working towards:
<ul>
 	<li>Bootstrapping a company and releasing GoProspr's MVP</li>
 	<li>Organising the first <a href="https://homebrewbrum.co.uk">Homebrew Website Club Birmingham</a> meetup</li>
 	<li>Improving my diet</li>
        <li>Going for a run <em>at least</em> twice a week
</ul>
<!-- You can read more about these on my own <a href="/now">now page</a>. -->

<em>Last updated:</em> <a href="https://github.com/ptibbetts/backup-of.paultibbetts.uk/commit/21760608bcb9d7439de87b042988c6a53a0068cf">September, 2016</a>.
<h2>about this website</h2>
I have my own site so thatÂ I can own my own data. I'll be adding <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a> features to it on an ongoing basis.

It's currently built with WordPress using the <a href="https://roots.io/trellis">Trellis</a>, <a href="https://roots.io/bedrock">Bedrock</a> and <a href="https://roots.io/sage">Sage</a> stack by the <a href="https://roots.io">Roots</a> team.

It's made up of four parts, there's:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://ptibbetts.github.io/styles.paultibbetts.uk/">the styleguide</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/ptibbetts/allusion">the front-end code</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/ptibbetts/paultibbetts.uk">the back-end code</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/ptibbetts/backup-of.paultibbetts.uk">the backup</a></li>
</ul>
