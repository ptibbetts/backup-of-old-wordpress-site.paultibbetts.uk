Hi, my name's Paul Tibbetts and you're currently looking at my website.

<img class="u-roundEdges" src="https://placehold.it/1280x840&amp;text=ðŸ˜Ž" alt="" />

I'm a Full Stack Developer, currently spending alternate weeks in Birmingham and London in the UK.

For now the best online version of my CV is my <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/paultibbetts">LinkedIn profile</a>.
<h2>What I'm interested in right now</h2>
Inspired by <a href="https://sivers.org/now">Derek Sivers' now page</a>, here's a list of things I'm currently working towards:
<ul>
 	<li>Building an app with Laravel and Vue.js</li>
 	<li>Reading more</li>
 	<li>Writing more</li>
 	<li>Going for a run 3 times a week</li>
</ul>
<!-- You can read more about these on my own <a href="/now">now page</a>. -->

<em>Last updated:</em> June, 2016.
