<h2>Thank you</h2>

Thank you all for coming to <a href="https://homebrewbrum.co.uk">Homebrew Brum</a> the other night!

My personal highlight was finding out that <a href="https://github.com/hwcbrum/hwcbrum.github.io/blob/9f39a07518c764c630da9bef40156a49e22c944a/calendar.ics">the ICS file</a> that gets generated by the Homebrew Brum website (which is made with Jekyll) not only gets picked up by <a href="http://calendar.birmingham.io">the Birmingham.io calendar</a> but also appears on the <a href="http://siliconcanal.co.uk/events/">Silicon Canal Events page</a>, which meant that Josh turned up.

<h2>Notes</h2>
I've posted the notes I took on the night using <a href="https://noterlive.com">NoterLive</a> to the <a href="<a href="https://homebrewbrum.co.uk/2016/11/23">Homebrew Brum site</a>.

We haven't yet set up webmentions so if you've also written something about the night you can send a pull request to <a href="https://github.com/hwcbrum/hwcbrum.github.io">the GitHub repo</a> to add your link to it.

<h2>Should there be a Homebrew Brum Slack channel?</h2>

I heard quite a few people (myself included) say that they wanted some accountability for posting on their own site, so it doesn't seem right to have a dedicated Slack channel.

That said, sometimes you can't beat talking in real-time.

There's a <a>#homebrewbrum</a> channel on the <a href="https://inlineblock.co.uk">inlineblock</a> Slack community that Dave, Marc and I use to organise the meetups.

There's also <a href="http://slack.birmingham.io">slack.birmingham.io</a> and Birmingham's own tech-related Discourse at <a href="https://talk.birmingham.io">talk.birmingham.io</a> so there's plenty of opportunities to have real and almost-real-time communications with each other.

<h2>When's the next one?</h2>

The next meetup will be on <strong>Wednesday the 25th of January</strong> (2017) in The Map Room at <a href="http://cherryreds.com">Cherry Reds</a> again.

You can click <a href="https://homebrewbrum.co.uk/calendar.ics">here</a> to add it to your calendar.

<h2>What should I do in the meantime?</h2>

I'll be at Matt's <a href="http://offtherecord.club">Off The Record</a> meetup tomorrow night at Cherry Reds.

The next <a href="http://meetup.com/hydrahack/events/234755943/">HydraHack developer meetup</a> is in December at 1000 Trades in the JQ. It's on side projects so I'm really looking forward to it.

Stuart's planning another <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/jqtechxmas/">JQ Ale Trail</a> between Christmas and New Year.

See you next time!
