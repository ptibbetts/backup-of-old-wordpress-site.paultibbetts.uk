Hi, my name's Paul Tibbetts and you're currently looking at my website.

<img class="u-roundEdges" src="https://placehold.it/1280x840&amp;text=ðŸ˜Ž" alt="" />

I'm a front end web developer at <a href="https://thebluecube.com">The Blue Cube</a>, based in the Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham, UK.

For now the best online version of my CV is my <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/paultibbetts">LinkedIn profile</a>.
<h2>What I'm interested in right now</h2>
Inspired by <a href="https://sivers.org/now">Derek Sivers' now page</a>, here's a list of things I'm currently working towards:
<ul>
	<li>Taking part in <a href="https://marcjenkins.co.uk/30dwc/">Marc's 30 Day Writing Challenge</a></li>
	<li>Learning <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> to help me build things on the front end</li>
	<li>Learning <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> so I can build my own apps</li>
	<li>Improving my fitness by getting into the gym and running again</li>
</ul>

<!-- You can read more about these on my own <a href="../pages/now.html">now page</a>. -->

<h2>About this website</h2>
This website acts as my central hub online. I'm trying to add as many <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com">IndieWeb</a> features as I can to help me <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/own-your-data">own my own data</a>.

It's built with WordPress using <a href="https://roots.io/trellis">Trellis</a>, <a href="https://roots.io/bedrock">Bedrock</a> and <a href="https://roots.io/sage">Sage</a> (all by the <a href="https://roots.io">Roots</a> team).

It's made up of four parts, there's:
<ul>
	<li>the styleguide, available at <a href="https://ptibbetts.github.io/styles.paultibbetts.uk/">https://ptibbetts.github.io/styles.paultibbetts.uk/</a></li>
	<li>the frontend code, available at <a href="https://github.com/ptibbetts/allusion">https://github.com/ptibbetts/allusion</a></li>
	<li>the backend code, available at <a href="https://github.com/ptibbetts/paultibbetts.uk">https://github.com/ptibbetts/paultibbetts.uk</a></li>
